## Blockly Maze Completion
After you complete the 10th level, what is the JavaScript code you got? 
Cut and paste and assign it to the variable level_10_code.



```
remaining_blocks = 5;


print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)

print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)

```
